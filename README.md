# Sunday School Application

#### A simple way to culminate data from students' attendance, contact information, and other information.

This sunday school application will enable superintendents of sunday schools to keep track of progress of students 
in the sunday school students. They will be able to group teachers and students in their class and store relevant 
student and teacher information (such a video and picture release consent).

***Note:*** all information above will be taken and stored by the sunday school superintendent for their individual classes,
and will be done only *after* individual or parental consent has been given.

#### Relevance of project to developer

The developer was raised in a small Church that continues to utilize outdated methods of data collection. 
Attendance is still recoreded on paper and then student's information are transferred to online calculating or graphical
software to determine trends in attendance fluctuations (amongst other things). Also, the process of grouping sunday 
school students and volunteer drivers, continues to be done inefficiently. It is the developer's hope to utilize this
application to optimize the attendance and information collection processes listed above such that eventually, the 
application could be extended to provide various graphical depictions of the sunday school's progress, as well as to 
create efficient carpools groups which minimize the distance that each driver has to drive.
