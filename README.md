- Save a sunday school class

 given.

#### Relevance of project to developer

The developer was raised in a small Church that continues to utilize outdated methods of data collection. 
Attendance is recorded on paper and then student's information are transferred to graphical
software to determine trends in attendance fluctuations (amongst other things). It is the developer's hope to utilize this
application to optimize this attendance collection process.
