# Sunday School Attendance Application

#### *A simple way to keep track of students' and teachers' attendance in a sunday school class*

This sunday school application will enable superintendents of sunday schools to keep track of students' and teachers' 
attendance in a sunday school class. 

Users will be able to:
 - Create a class
 - View the people in class
 - Add or remove both teachers and students
 - Take attendance of everyone in the class

***Note:*** students' names and attendance in class will be taken only *after* individual or parental consent has been given.

#### Relevance of project to developer

The developer was raised in a small Church that continues to utilize outdated methods of data collection. 
Attendance is recorded on paper and then student's information are transferred to graphical
software to determine trends in attendance fluctuations (amongst other things). Also, the process of grouping sunday 
school students and volunteer drivers, continues to be done inefficiently. It is the developer's hope to utilize this
application to optimize this attendance collection process, such that eventually, the 
application could be extended to provide various graphical depictions of the sunday school class' progress, as well 
as to create efficient carpool groups which minimize the distance that each driver has to drive.
